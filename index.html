            <div>
                <h3>Market Opportunity</h3>
                <p>The target market includes indie software creators leveraging AI and design to produce unique applications, alongside early adopters and professionals seeking innovative alternatives to mainstream platforms.

                <h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
                <p>While major app stores dominate traditional software distribution, they don&#x27;t cater to the specific needs of indie creators focused on narrative, branding, and subscription revenue models.
